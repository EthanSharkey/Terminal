NAME

	myshell -- a shell made with python code

DESCRIPTION
	|	This shell is a simple command line interpreter with a few basic commands
	|	that work within the shell. It also supports output redirection and 
	|	background processes. It was designed and tested using python 3.6.7.
	|
	|	Output Redirection
	|		The shell can deal with output redirection where the output of a command
	|		can be written to a file instead of printed out on screen.
	|
	|		">" will create a file if the file does not already exist and write the
	|		ouput to that file.
	|
	|		">>" will append the output to a file.
	|
	|	Background Processes
	|		The shell can also support background processes. Just add the symbol
	|		"&" to the end of a command and it will begin running in the background.
	|		There should be no space inbetween the last wordand the ampersand for
	|		example:
	|		
	|		"python3 test.py&" and not "python3 test.py &" - this won't work and you
	|		will get an error
	|
	|		Background processes work for functions that are in the shell but not system
	|		binaries. All built in commands are listed below.
	|
	|	BatchFiles
	|
	|		The shell also supports supports taking a file that has commands, one per 
	|		line as a command line argument. What will happen is that the shell will 
	|		execute these commands, display the results of these commands on screen 
	|		in the terminal and then it will quit the shell.

LIST OF POSSIBLE COMMANDS


	NAME
		"cd"

	DESCRIPTION
		|	The command "cd" is used to change where you are currently located,

		|	enter your documents folder, you would write "cd Documents" and 
		|	you will now be currently situated in your documents folder. If 
		|	you wanted to reverse this process and go from your documents folder
		|	back to home, you would type "cd .." and that will bring you back to
		|	your home environment.
		|
		|	You can only "cd" into other directories, for example, you can't do 
		|	"cd output.txt". It's just not possible.
